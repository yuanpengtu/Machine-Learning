# Gaussian-Mean-Shift-Clustering
Implement mean-shift clustering algorithm for the segmentation of the following RGB image: “input3.jpg". Set the parameters (hs: spatial resolution, hr: range resolution) according to the properties of the attached image. Briefly mention optimality of why and how you decide those parameters along with the output. There is no ground truth available for this image as this question is intended to be a blind-competitions among attendants. Best segmentation method will be decided and announced based TP rate, FP rate, and F-score (use isotropic Gaussian kernel). In the pseudo-code, p(n|x) is posterior probability, and x’s update means difference of x’s values between consecutive iterations.
